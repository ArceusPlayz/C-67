Once a upon a time, there were 3 little pigs that lived with Mama Pig. One day, they all got too old,
so Mama Pig said, "It's time for you guys to move out and explore the world. I'm too old now to take care
of you all." So, all the three little pigs went out to explore the world. Youngest Pig built his house out of straw. 
The Middle Pig built his house out of sticks while the Oldest Pig built his house out of bricks. All were proud
of their homes. Until the Big Bad Wolf came. When we came upon the first house made out of straws, he came up to the door
and said to Youngest Pig "Open the door beause I'm hungry." The Youngest Pig said, "No, not by the hair of my chinny chin chin."
So the Big Bad Wolf huffed, and puffed, and blew the house down, and Youngest Pig ran to Middle Pig's house which was the one
made out of sticks. But later, the Big Bad Wolf found them.
